# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security reports.

Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories for private reporting:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Security**.
3. Click **Report a vulnerability**.

If GitHub Security Advisories are not available, open an issue with minimal
details and request a private contact channel.
